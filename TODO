General:
  - Proper context override?
Art:
  - Compare bumping with MB-Lab?
  - Hairstyles

Creation tools:
  - Simple MB-Lab import/export tools
  - Rigging tool
  - Joints offsets
  - Fix L2__Body_Size_min and export it back to MB-Lab

Char creation:
  - Asset list in creation panel
  - Create at 3D cursor

Morphing:
  - Move out shape keys to npy/npz files
  - Apply morphs (options: Corrective smooth (char, assets), Subdivision (char, assets): [Render only, Viewport(slow)], rig type)
  - Choice between materials displacement and displacement modifier
  - Allow to mix L1 shapes

Materials:
  - Ability to disable skin features (blush, freckles)
    and completely remove them from node tree removing unneccessary texture images too
  - Texture layers?

  - Choice between separate and combined masks
  - MakeHuman asset support ?
  - Bounding box transform?

  - Ability to select MB-Lab fitting algorithm
  - Use avg instead of max for thresh? I think no, we need to use no less than first n
  - Replace censors with default underwear

Assets:
  - Asset list at creation
  - Use default assets instead of censors

Rigging:
  - Everything :)
  - Rigify at all
  - Live regular rig deform
  - Chioce between expression shape keys and Rigify face rig
  - Rigify morphing?
  - Import pose library from MB-Lab
  - Muscles
  - Blenrig
