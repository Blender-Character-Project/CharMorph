General:
  - Proper context handling (use bpy.context only if really necessary)

Performance:
  - Fast YAML library

Art:
  - Compare bumping with MB-Lab?
  - More hairstyles

Char creation:
  - Asset list in creation panel

Morphing:
  - Allow to mix L1 shapes

Finalize:
  - Choice between materials displacement and displacement modifier

Materials:
  - Lip color control?
  - Ability to disable skin features (blush, freckles)
    and completely remove them from node tree removing unneccessary texture images too
  - Texture layers?

Randomize:
  - Randomize eye and skin colors

Hair:
  - Move hair.blend to char.blend?
  - Hair refitting after edit

Fitting:
  - MakeHuman asset support ?
  - Bounding box transform?
  - More fitting settings? (Thresholds and so on)
  - Asset baking
  - Get fitting base from library
  - Ability to select MB-Lab fitting algorithm
  - Use avg instead of max for thresh? I think no, we need to use no less than first n

Assets:
  - Use default underwear assets instead of censors -- done for Antonia
  - Asset-defined heels and morphs

Rigging:
  - Add chest and abdomen bones for breathing -- done for Antonia
  - Pupil dilation bones -- done for Antonia
  - Size and limb length morphs for Antonia
  - Force bone bending angle
  - Head pivot shift
  - Live regular rig deform
  - Import MB-Lab expression shape keys alongside with Rigify
  - Rigify morphing? Maybe even create an own Rigify-like rig system?
  - Blenrig

Editing:
  - Retopology
  - Simple MB-Lab import/export tools
  - Fix L2__Body_Size_min and export it back to MB-Lab

Pose:
  - Fix glitchy capture poses
  - Different mix modes
  - Native pose support (not just MB-Lab)
