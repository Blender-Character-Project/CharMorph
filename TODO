General:
  - Proper context override?

Art:
  - Compare bumping with MB-Lab?
  - Hairstyles

Creation tools:
  - Simple MB-Lab import/export tools
  - Fix L2__Body_Size_min and export it back to MB-Lab

Char creation:
  - Asset list in creation panel

Morphing:
  - Move out shape keys to npy/npz files
  - Allow to mix L1 shapes

Finalize:
  - Corrective smooth: simple, length weighed
  - Subsurf and corrective smooth for assets too
  - Choice between materials displacement and displacement modifier

Materials:
  - "Affect materials": [None/Absolute/Relative]
  - Ability to disable skin features (blush, freckles)
    and completely remove them from node tree removing unneccessary texture images too
  - Texture layers?

Fitting:
  - MakeHuman asset support ?
  - Bounding box transform?
  - More fitting settings? (Thresholds and so on)
  - Asset baking
  - Hair fitting
  - Get fitting base from library
  - Ability to select MB-Lab fitting algorithm
  - Use avg instead of max for thresh? I think no, we need to use no less than first n

Assets:
  - Asset list at creation
  - Use default underwear assets instead of censors

Rigging:
  - Armature modifier reorder (incorrect order may cause problems with hair)
  - More weight paint checking
  - Live regular rig deform
  - Import MB-Lab expression shape keys alongside with Rigify
  - Rigify morphing?
  - Import pose library from MB-Lab
  - Muscles
  - Blenrig
